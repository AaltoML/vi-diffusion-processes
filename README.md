# Variational Gaussian Process Diffusion Processes
This fork of **Markovflow** contains the official implementation of the methods in the publication:

* P. Verma, V. Adam, and A. Solin, (2024). **Variational Gaussian Process Diffusion Processes**. In *Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS)*. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02066)

Diffusion processes are a class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) providing a rich family of expressive models
that arise naturally in dynamic modelling tasks. Probabilistic inference and learning under generative models with 
latent processes endowed with a non-linear diffusion process prior are intractable problems. We build upon work within
variational inference, approximating the posterior process as a linear diffusion process, and point out pathologies 
in the approach. We propose an alternative parameterization of the Gaussian variational process using a site-based 
exponential family description. This allows us to trade a slow inference algorithm with fixed-point iterations for 
a fast algorithm for convex optimization akin to natural gradient descent, which also provides a better objective 
for learning model parameters

The VDP and CVI-DP models are present in the directory: `markovflow/models/`.

All the experiments included in the paper are present in the directory: `docs/diffusion_processes/`. For more details go through the following [README](docs/diffusion_processes/README.md).

## What does Markovflow do?

Markovflow is a Python library for time-series analysis via probabilistic inference in generative models with Markovian Gaussian Processes.

Markovflow uses the mathematical building blocks from [GPflow](http://www.gpflow.org/) and marries these with objects and operators dedicated to run inference and learning in linear dynamical systems. This combination leads to a framework that can be used for:

- researching new Markovian Gaussian process based models, and
- building, training, evaluating and deploying Gaussian processes in a modern way â€” making use of the tools developed by the deep learning community.


## Getting started

In the [Documentation](https://secondmind-labs.github.io/markovflow/), we have multiple [Tutorials](https://secondmind-labs.github.io/markovflow/tutorials.html) showing the basic functionality of the toolbox,
and a comprehensive [API reference](https://secondmind-labs.github.io/markovflow/autoapi/markovflow/index.html).


## Install Markovflow

This project is assuming you are using `python3`.

#### For users

To install the latest (stable) release of the toolbox from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), use `pip`:
```bash
$ pip install markovflow
```
#### For contributors

To install this project in editable mode, run the commands below from the root directory of the `markovflow` repository.
```bash
poetry install
```
Check that the installation was successful by running the tests:
```bash
poetry run task test
```
You can have a peek at the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) for the commands.
